## Use case

Android Jetpack Compose is designed to be more efficient and performant than XML layouts. It allows you to define UI in a more declarative and composable way. Compose is also designed to work seamlessly with Kotlin. 

## How to use the sample

Run the sample to view the map. Pan and zoom to navigate the map.

## How it works

1. Create an `ArcGISMap` with a basemap style `ArcGISNavigationNight`.
2. Set the map to the map view with `mapView.map = map`.
