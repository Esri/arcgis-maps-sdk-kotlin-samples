# Show result of spatial operations

Find the union, intersection, or difference of two geometries.

## Use case

The different spatial operations (union, difference, symmetric difference, and intersection) can be used for a variety of spatial analyses. For example, government authorities may use the intersect operation to determine whether a proposed road cuts through a restricted piece of land such as a nature reserve or a private property.

When these operations are chained together, they become even more powerful. An analysis of food deserts within an urban area might begin by union-ing service areas of grocery stores, farmer's markets, and food co-ops. Taking the difference between this single geometry of all services areas and that of a polygon delineating a neighborhood would reveal the areas within that neighborhood where access to healthy, whole foods may not exist.

## How to use the sample

Select a spatial operation from the overflow menu. When an operation is selected, the resulting geometry is shown in red.

## How it works

1. Create two `GraphicsOverlay`s, one to show polygons and another to show the relationships between them.
2. Define a `PolygonBuilder` of each `Geometry`.
3. Add the overlapping polygons to a graphics overlay.
4. Perform spatial relationships between the polygons by using the appropriate operation:
    * `GeometryEngine.union(geometry1, geometry2)` - This method returns the two geometries united together as one geometry.
    * `GeometryEngine.difference(geometry1, geometry2)` - This method returns any part of Geometry2 that does not intersect Geometry1.
    * `GeometryEngine.symmetricDifference(geometry1, geometry2)` - This method returns any part of Geometry1 or Geometry2 which do not intersect.
    * `GeometryEngine.intersection(geometry1, geometry2)` - This method returns the intersection of Geometry1 and Geometry2.
5. Add the resultant geometry to a new `Graphic` and display it by adding it to the second `GraphicsOverlay`.
