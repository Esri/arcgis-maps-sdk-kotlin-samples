# Find route in transport network

Solve a route on-the-fly using offline data.

## Use case

You can use an offline network to enable routing in disconnected scenarios. For example, you could provide offline location capabilities to field workers repairing critical infrastructure in a disaster when network availability is limited.

## How to use the sample

Tap once near a road to add a stop to the map. A number graphic will show its order in the route. After adding at least 2 stops, a route will display. Choose "Fastest" or "Shortest" from the switch at the top of the screen to control how the route is optimized. The route will update on-the-fly while moving stops. The green box marks the boundary of the routable area provided by the offline data.

## How it works

1. Create the map's `Basemap` from a local tile package using a `TileCache` and `ArcGISTiledLayer`.
2. Create a `RouteTask` with an offline locator geodatabase.
3. Get the `RouteParameters` using `routeTask.createDefaultParameters()`.
4. Create `Stop`s and add them to the route task's parameters using `RouteParameters.setStops(...)`.
5. Solve the `Route` using `routeTask.solveRoute(routeParameters)`.
6. Create a graphic with the route's geometry and a `SimpleLineSymbol` and display it on another `GraphicsOverlay`.

## About the data

This sample uses a pre-packaged [sample dataset](https://arcgisruntime.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=df193653ed39449195af0c9725701dca) consisting of a geodatabase with a San Diego road routing network and a tile package with a streets basemap.
