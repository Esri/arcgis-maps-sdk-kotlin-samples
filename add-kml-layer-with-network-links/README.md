## Use case

KML files can reference other KML files on the network and support automatically refreshing content. For example, survey workers will benefit from KML data shown on their devices automatically refreshing to show the most up-to-date state. Additionally, discovering KML files linked to the data they are currently viewing provides additional information to make better decisions in the field.

## How to use the sample

The sample will load the KML file automatically. The data shown should refresh automatically every few seconds. Pan and zoom to explore the map.

## How it works

1. Create a `KmlDataset` from a KML source which has network links.
2. Construct a `KmlLayer` with the dataset and add the layer as an operational layer with `Scene.operationalLayers.add(kmlLayer)`.
3. To listen for network messages, collect them from `KmlDataset.kmlNetworkLinkMessageReceived`.
