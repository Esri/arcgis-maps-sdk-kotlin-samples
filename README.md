# ArcGIS Maps SDK Kotlin Samples

## Overview

ArcGIS Maps SDK for Kotlin v200.2.0 samples.  The `main` branch of this repository contains sample app modules for the latest available version of the [ArcGIS Maps SDK Android Kotlin](https://developers.arcgis.com/kotlin/). Samples released under older versions can be found through the [git tags](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-maps-sdk-kotlin-samples/tags).  Please read our [wiki](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-maps-sdk-kotlin-samples/wiki) for help with working with this repository.

## Prerequisites

* The samples are building with `compileSdkVersion 33`
* [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
* [An ArcGIS Developers API key](https://developers.arcgis.com/kotlin/get-started/#3-get-an-api-key)

## Developer Instructions

Please read our [developer instructions wiki page](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-maps-sdk-kotlin-samples/wiki/Developer-Instructions) to set up your developer environment with Android Studio.  Instructions include forking and cloning the repository for those new to Git.

Once the project is cloned to disk you can import into Android Studio:

* From the Welcome to Android Studio screen, click the **Open** button. (If you're already inside a project, click **File > Open** in the menu bar instead.)
* Navigate to the **arcgis-maps-sdk-kotlin-samples/** folder and click **OK**.

## Accessing Esri location services

Accessing Esri location services, including basemaps, routing, and geocoding, requires authentication using either an API Key or an ArcGIS identity:

### API key

A permanent key that gives your application access to Esri location services. Visit your [ArcGIS Developers Dashboard](https://developers.arcgis.com/dashboard) to create a new API key or access an existing API key.
The Android samples in this repository have been structured to use an API key, set once, which will run in all samples.
Set your API key in the `gradle.properties` file located in the `/.gradle` folder within your home directory.
The API_KEY property should contain quotes around the key itself:
```gradle
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY" // path: /Users/<user_name>/.gradle/gradle.properties
```

### ArcGIS identity

An ArcGIS named user account that is a member of an organization in ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise.

## Run a sample

Once you have set up your developer environment you can run any sample from within Android Studio by selecting the app module from the **Edit Configurations** drop down and clicking the **Run** button from the toolbar.

### Build/Run sample from Gradle

You can execute all the build tasks using the [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) command line tool. It's available as a batch file for Windows (gradlew.bat) and a shell script for Linux/Mac (gradlew.sh) and it is accessible from the root of the project.  

* Build a debug APK

```
$ ./gradlew assembleDebug
```

* Install the app on the device

```adb
adb -d install path/to/sample.apk
```

Built APK's are saved to **arcgis-maps-sdk-kotlin-samples/[module-name]/build/outputs/apk/**. More information about running apps on devices can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device.html).
